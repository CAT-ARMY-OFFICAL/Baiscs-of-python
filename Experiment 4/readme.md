📘 UNIT 4 – Operations on Tuples
🎯 Aim

To study the concept of tuples in Python and to perform various operations such as accessing elements, repetition, concatenation, and other basic tuple operations using Python programs.

🛠️ Tools Required

💻 Google Colab – for writing and executing Python programs efficiently

📂 GitHub – for maintaining, documenting, and sharing Python programs and experiments

📚 Theory

A tuple in Python is a built-in data structure used to store multiple elements within a single variable. Tuples are similar to lists in terms of indexing and ordering but differ significantly in their immutability.

Key characteristics of tuples include:

📌 Ordered – elements are stored in a fixed sequence and can be accessed using indexes

🔒 Immutable – elements cannot be changed, added, or removed once the tuple is created

🧩 Heterogeneous – can store different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and more

⚡ Faster than lists – due to immutability, tuple operations are generally more efficient

Tuples are commonly used when data integrity is important and values should remain constant throughout program execution.

⚙️ Operations on Tuples

Some of the commonly performed operations on tuples in Python are:

🆕 Creating a Tuple
Tuples are created using round brackets () with elements separated by commas.

🔍 Accessing Elements
Elements of a tuple can be accessed using indexing and slicing.

➕ Concatenation of Tuples
Two or more tuples can be combined using the + operator.

🔁 Repetition of Tuples
A tuple can be repeated multiple times using the * operator.

📏 Finding the Length of a Tuple

len() – Returns the total number of elements present in the tuple.

🚫 Modification Restrictions
Tuples do not support insertion, deletion, or modification of elements due to their immutable nature.

✅ Conclusion

Thus, the study of tuples and their operations in Python was successfully completed. Tuples provide a safe and reliable way to store fixed data because of their immutability. Understanding tuples is essential for efficient data handling and forms a fundamental building block of Python programming, especially in situations where data consistency is required.
