Loops in Python
<div align="center"> <h1>🔁 LOOPS IN PYTHON</h1> <h3>Repetition & Iteration in Programming</h3> </div>
<h2>What are Loops?</h2>

Loops are control structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

They are useful when you need to perform repetitive tasks or iterate over data collections.

Loops are fundamental in:

Data Processing

Automation Scripts

Iterating Through Lists, Tuples, or Strings

Game Development

Algorithm Design

Understanding loops is essential for efficient coding and problem-solving.

<h1>Core Loop Structures</h1> <h2>1. for Loop</h2>

The <b>for</b> loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

<h3>When to Use</h3>

When you know the number of iterations

When iterating over a collection of items (lists, dictionaries, etc.)

When you need to perform actions for each item in a sequence

<h2>2. while Loop</h2>

The <b>while</b> loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is True.

<h3>When to Use</h3>

When you don't know how many times you need to loop

When a condition is dynamically checked on each iteration

<h1>Loop Control Statements</h1>

Loop control statements help modify the flow of loops.

<h3>Main Loop Control Statements</h3>

break: Exits the loop prematurely

continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one

pass: Does nothing, acts as a placeholder

<h1>Nested Loops</h1>

A nested loop is a loop inside another loop.

<h3>When to Use</h3>

When working with multi-dimensional data (e.g., matrices, tables)

When performing more complex iterations

<h1>List Comprehensions</h1>

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists by performing an operation on each element of an existing list or range.

<h3>When to Use</h3>

When you need to create new lists with a short, readable syntax

When performing operations on each element of an iterable

<h1>Practical Applications</h1>

Loops are used in:

Data cleaning and transformation

Traversing data structures like lists, sets, and dictionaries

Processing user input or files

Automating repetitive tasks

Simulating behaviors (e.g., game loops)

<h1>Best Practices</h1>

Use <b>for</b> loops when iterating over a collection or known range

Use <b>while</b> loops for dynamic or uncertain iterations

Avoid infinite loops by ensuring the condition will eventually become False

Use list comprehensions for cleaner and more readable code when possible

Loops are essential for repetitive tasks and efficient data processing.
Mastering loops enables you to automate tasks and write efficient code.
