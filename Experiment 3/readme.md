📘 UNIT 3 – Study of Lists & Various Operations on Them
🎯 Aim

To understand the concept of lists in Python and to perform various operations on lists such as insertion, deletion, slicing, sorting, and other commonly used list manipulations using Python programs.

🛠️ Tools Required

💻 Google Colab – for writing and executing Python programs in an interactive environment

📂 GitHub – for storing, maintaining, and sharing Python programs and experiments

📚 Theory

In Python, a list is a built-in data structure used to store multiple values within a single variable. Lists are one of the four fundamental collection data types in Python, along with tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

Lists have the following important characteristics:

📌 Ordered – elements have a fixed position and can be accessed using indexing

🔁 Mutable – elements can be modified after creation

🧩 Heterogeneous – can store integers, floats, strings, and even other lists

♻️ Allows duplicates – same values can appear multiple times

Due to their flexibility and ease of use, lists are widely used in real-world programming tasks such as data processing, storage, and manipulation.

⚙️ Common List Operations

Some of the most frequently used operations on lists in Python include:

🆕 Creating a List
Lists are created using square brackets [] with elements separated by commas.

➕ Insertion Operations

append() – Adds an element at the end of the list

insert() – Inserts an element at a specified position

➖ Deletion Operations

remove() – Removes the first occurrence of a specified element

🔍 Accessing Elements

Indexing and slicing are used to access specific elements or a range of elements

📏 Finding the Length of a List

len() – Returns the total number of elements in the list

🔢 Sorting the List

sort() – Arranges the list elements in ascending or descending order

🔄 Other Useful Operations

Traversing lists using loops

Updating existing elements

Checking membership using the in keyword

✅ Conclusion

Thus, the study of lists and their various operations in Python was successfully performed. Lists provide a powerful and efficient way to store, access, and manipulate data. Understanding list operations is essential for solving real-world programming problems and forms a strong foundation for advanced data structures and algorithms in Python.
