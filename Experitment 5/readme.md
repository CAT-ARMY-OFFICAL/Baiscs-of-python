Sets & Dictionaries
<div align="center"> <h1>🧠 SETS & DICTIONARIES</h1> <h3>Core Data Structures in Python</h3> </div>
<h2>What are Sets and Dictionaries?</h2>

Sets and Dictionaries are built-in Python data structures used to store and organize data efficiently.

They are widely used in:

Software Development

Data Science

Backend Systems

Automation Scripts

Competitive Programming

Understanding them is essential for writing clean and efficient Python code.

<h1>Core Data Structures</h1> <h2>1. Sets</h2>

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

It is best used when you need to store distinct values without duplicates.

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

Stores only unique values

Unordered (no indexing)

Mutable (can add or remove items)

Fast membership testing

<h2>2. Dictionaries</h2>

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

Each key is unique and maps to a specific value.

It is ideal for structured and labeled data.

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

Key-value structure

Keys must be unique

Mutable

Fast lookup using keys

<h1>Key Features</h1>

Efficient data storage

Fast searching and retrieval

Support for dynamic updates

Useful built-in operations

Flexible data handling

Widely used in real-world applications

<h1>Working with Sets</h1>

Sets allow you to:

Remove duplicate values

Check membership quickly

Perform mathematical operations

Compare collections of data

<h3>Common Operations</h3>

Adding elements

Removing elements

Union

Intersection

Difference

<h1>Working with Dictionaries</h1>

Dictionaries allow you to:

Store structured information

Access data using keys

Update values dynamically

Iterate through key-value pairs

<h3>Common Operations</h3>

Accessing values

Adding new entries

Updating existing entries

Removing entries

Looping through items

<h1>Sets vs Dictionaries</h1>
Feature	Sets	Dictionaries
Structure	Unique values	Key-value pairs
Duplicates	Not allowed	Keys must be unique
Access Method	Membership check	Access via keys
Best For	Unique collections	Structured data
