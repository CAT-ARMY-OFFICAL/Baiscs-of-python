📌 Title of the Experiment

Study of Basics of Python Programming

🎯 Aim

The aim of this experiment is to study and understand the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. This includes learning basic syntax, variables, data types, operators, input/output statements, control structures, and functions to build a strong programming foundation.

🛠️ Software and Tools Required

💻 Programming Language: Python 3.x

🖥️ Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

📝 IDE / Editor: IDLE, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm

⚙️ System Requirements: Minimum 2 GB RAM and basic processor

📘 Theory

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It is widely popular due to its simple syntax, readability, and ease of learning, making it suitable for beginners and professionals alike.

Python programs are executed line by line using an interpreter, which makes debugging easier. The language supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

🔹 Basic Concepts of Python
1️⃣ Variables

Variables are used to store data values in memory. Python does not require explicit declaration of data types.

x = 10
name = "Python"

2️⃣ Data Types

Python supports various built-in data types:

🔢 Integer (int)

🔣 Floating point (float)

🔤 String (str)

✅ Boolean (bool)

📚 List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set

3️⃣ Operators

Operators perform operations on variables and values:

➕ Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)

🔍 Relational Operators (>, <, ==, !=)

🔗 Logical Operators (and, or, not)

4️⃣ Input and Output Statements

input() is used to take input from the user

print() is used to display output

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)

5️⃣ Control Statements

Control statements manage the flow of program execution:

🔁 Conditional Statements: if, elif, else

🔄 Looping Statements: for loop, while loop

6️⃣ Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code defined using the def keyword. They improve modularity and reduce repetition.

🧪 Procedure

Install Python 3.x on the system.

Open the Python IDE or code editor.

Write basic Python programs to demonstrate variables, data types, and operators.

Execute the programs and observe the output.

Modify the programs to explore control statements and functions.

✅ Result

The basic concepts of Python programming such as variables, data types, operators, input/output statements, control structures, and functions were successfully studied and implemented.

🏁 Conclusion

Python is an easy-to-learn, efficient, and powerful programming language. Understanding its basic concepts provides a strong foundation for advanced programming topics and real-world applications such as web development, data science, and automation.# Baiscs-of-python
